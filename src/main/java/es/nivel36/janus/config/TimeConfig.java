/**
 * Spring {@link Configuration} class that provides time-related beans.
 * <p>
 * Exposes a {@link Clock} bean representing the system's default time-zone.
 * <p>
 * Using {@link Clock} instead of calling {@code LocalDateTime.now()} directly
 * improves testability by allowing the clock to be injected and controlled in
 * unit tests (e.g., by providing a fixed or offset clock).
 *
 * <p>
 * Example usage in a service:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Service
 * public class TimeLogService {
 * 	private final Clock clock;
 *
 * 	public TimeLogService(Clock clock) {
 * 		this.clock = clock;
 * 	}
 *
 * 	public Instant now() {
 * 		return clock(now);
 * 	}
 * }
