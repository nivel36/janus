/**
 * Entity representing a time log entry for an {@link Employee}.

 * A time log records the clock-in ({@code entryTime}) and optional clock-out
 * ({@code exitTime}) instants of an employee at a specific {@link Worksite}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each time log is uniquely identified by the combination of the employee and
 * the entry time, enforced through a unique constraint. The entity also
 * supports logical deletion via the {@code deleted} flag, which ensures that
 * records remain in the database for auditing purposes even after they are
 * "deleted".
